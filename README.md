#### About project

The Ignite Call project was built for booking appointments from a calendar with Google Calendar integration. Users can register for the app using their Google account and indicate their days of the week and times when they will be available to schedule appointments. Every schedule registered in the application has integration with Google Calendar, which allows the user to check their new appointments directly on the Google platform.

Ignite Call was built entirely on a Next.js project and used the mechanisms provided by the framework to create and integrate the front-end and back-end from a single code repository. Communication between the application and the database was done using the Prisma.io tool and using a MySQL database in a Docker container. The production database was published from the PlanetScale platform service and Vercel's service was used to host the application.

In this application we also use our Design System, which we created in the last module.
